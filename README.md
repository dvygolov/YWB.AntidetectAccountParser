# Antidetect Accounts Parser by [Yellow Web](https://yellowweb.top)
This program automatically: 
- parses a file with Facebook accounts (or zip/rar-files with 1 FB account for each file)
- creates a profile for each account in your Antidetect browser
- imports cookies into the profile
- saves all account's info into profile's note

Right now this software supports 3 Antidetect browsers: 
- [Indigo](https://yellowweb.top/indigo) - (btw, you can use **YELLOW** promocode to get 50% cashback)
- [Dolphin Anty](https://yellowweb.top/dolphinanty)
- [AdsPower](https://yellowweb.top/adspower)

Also you can import your accounts to monitoring services. Right now these are supported:
- [FbTool](https://yellowweb.top/fbtool) 
- [Dolphin](https://yellowweb.top/dolphin)
**YELLOW** promocode will give you a discount for both!
