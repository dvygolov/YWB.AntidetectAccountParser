# YWB.AntidetectAccountParser
This program automatically parses a file with Facebook accounts (or zip/rar-files with 1 FB account for each file), creates profiles in Indigo or Dolphin Anty browser, imports cookies and saves all account's info into profile's note.

1. Create proxy.txt file in the program's directory
2. Add your proxies there line by line in this format - proxytype:ip:port:login:password, for example, socks:133.43.23.4:10003:julia:sanders
3. If you have multiple accounts in a text file rename the file to accounts.txt and put it into the program's folder
4. If you have accounts in archives then create "logs" folder and put them there
5. Start the program and enjoy
