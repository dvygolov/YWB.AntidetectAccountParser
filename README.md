Статья по софту на русском языке [находится тут](https://yellowweb.top/massovyj-import-akkauntov-facebook-v-profili-indigo-na-izi/)

This program automatically: 
- parses a file with Facebook accounts (or zip/rar-files with 1 FB account for each file)
- checks if accounts are valid (two types of checks are performed)
- creates a profile for each account in your Antidetect browser
- imports cookies into the profile
- saves all account's info into profile's note

Right now this software supports 4 Antidetect browsers: 
- [Indigo](https://yellowweb.top/indigo) - (btw, you can use **YELLOW** promocode to get 50% cashback)
- [Dolphin Anty](https://yellowweb.top/dolphinanty)
- [AdsPower](https://yellowweb.top/adspower)
- [OctoBrowser](https://octobrowser.net)

Also you can import your accounts to monitoring services. Right now these are supported:
- [FbTool](https://yellowweb.top/fbtool) 
- [Dolphin](https://yellowweb.top/dolphin)

**YELLOW** promocode will give you a discount for both!

# How to use this software
1. Compile the source code
2. Start your browser and leave it opened (except Octo, you don't need to launch it for the program to work)
3. Create **proxy.txt** file in the compiled program's directory
4. Add your proxies there line by line in this format - proxytype:ip:port:login:password, for example, *socks:133.43.23.4:10003:julia:sanders*
5. If you use [Dolphin Anty](https://yellowweb.top/dolphinanty) you can also add your proxy's update IP url, for example: *socks:133.43.23.4:10003:julia:sanders:yourproxy.com/erxc34sxre/update.php*
6. If you have multiple accounts in a text file then rename this file to **accounts.txt** and put it into the program's folder
7. If you have accounts in archives then create **"logs"** folder and put them there. Remember, there should be 1 account per 1 zip. You can also use Folders not archives, also 1 folder for one account.
8. Start the program and follow the instructions.
